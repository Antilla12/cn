Aim: Use Wireshark to understand the operation of TCP/IP layers :
⚫ Ethernet Layer : Frame header, Frame size etc.
⚫ Data Link Layer : MAC address, ARP (IP and MAC address binding)
⚫ Network Layer : IP Packet (header, fragmentation), ICMP (Query and Echo)
⚫ Transport Layer: TCP Ports, TCP handshake segments etc.
⚫ Application Layer: DHCP, FTP, HTTP header formats

Hardware/Software required: Wireshark

Wireshark Installation steps:
1. Enter admin mode by following command. If not entered in admin mode then packets will not get captured in wireshark.
sudo su

2. Command to install wireshark on ubuntu
sudo apt-get install wireshark

3. Double click on the wireshark icon. We get an open window as given below.

TCP Three-way Handshake
The delta value between frames 1 and 2 can be used as a TCP transport connect baseline value. Other important information gathered from this handshake: • Window Size • SACK • Maximum Segment Size • Window Scale Option value
